# What is GDB
GDB or GNU Debugger is a GNU project which helps with debugging software and binaries. It allows the user to analyze what is happening during the program execution. It is a tool to find out what causes a bug in a program or in the case of this lab, understand how a program runs and which memory is addressed at which point of the execution. \
It allows the user to pause an execution and print or even change the different pointer values at any time which is a tremendous help in reversing a binary.

# Introduction
This is a simple reverse engineering challenge. Please start the vulnerable service from `RESOURCES`. The vulnerable service is offering two ports.
- port **1345** (vulnerable service)
- port **80** (download server binary)

# Task
* analyze server binary 
* exploit the remote service on port `1345`
* disclose the flag from the remote service

# Artifacts
* please download the server binary from the vulnerable service on port `80`

# Hint
* by analyzing the server binary you will find out the built-in vulnerability

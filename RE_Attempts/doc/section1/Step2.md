## TinyC - Finding the requirements
1. First step is to find the main function. If you can't find it, remember what you did in the Introduction 2 part.
2. Here you will see after the program writing "running Program" a cmp is run which checks if the value in the eax is equal to 2. The key question here is what is written inside the eax at that moment?
3. Then there's another comparison which compares two strings. You can find one of the strings right there, but where does the second value come from?
4. Run the program with the correct requirements to get the second part of the Flag.

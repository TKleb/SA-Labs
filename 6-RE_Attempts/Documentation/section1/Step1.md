## C++ - Finding the comparison
There are multiple ways to solve this exercise. You can statically or dynamically solve this and even then you can find the solution in different ways. This solution will however only provide help in one way.
1. You can look for the text "Credentials are wrong" and from there you can look at the comparison that happened before that part gets executed.
2. Following this comparison you will see where the values get compared and also which inputs you need to do to get the Flag out of the program.
